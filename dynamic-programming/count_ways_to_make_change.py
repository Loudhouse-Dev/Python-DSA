# Problem:
# Given an array of distinct positive integers representing coin denominations and a single non-negative 
# integer n representing a target amount of money, write a function that returns the number of ways to 
# make change for that target amount using the given coin denominations.

# *You can assume that you have an infinite amount of coins.

def count_ways_to_make_change(n, denoms):
  ways = [0 for amount in range(n + 1)]
  ways[0] = 1
  for denom in denoms: 
      for amount in range(1, n + 1):
        if denom <= amount:
          ways[amount] += ways[amount - denom]
  return ways[n]
